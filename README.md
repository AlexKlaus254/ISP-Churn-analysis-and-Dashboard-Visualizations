# ISP-Churn-analysis-and-Dashboard-Visualizations
On the project, I analyzed a dataset containing 72, 275 observations of an internet service providing company with the goal of obtaining the rate of churn
On this specific project were my first days learning the fundamentals of Microsoft Excel software, I'll be glad to learn more from any issues you might observe
The data and project are to be used freely to whoever is interested, hoping you learn something too..
